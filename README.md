# MusicLoopDeluxe - Stardew Valley Music Mod.
</p>


## Introduction
This mod is a combination of 4 other music related mods for Stardew Valley, by combining them I intend for them to be easier to maintain.
It currently features the following:


## Loop Music
Background music will now loop, meaning no more silent times!

## Announce Tracks
Displays the currently playing music track when it starts.

## Pause Music while in-game menus
Based off 'StopSoundsWhenAltTabbed' This mod will pause music while in the menu.

## New Rain Tracks
Taken from the  broken mod 'Sounds of Rain'. Attempted to remove silence from the start, converted to ogg for smaller filesize.

## TO-DO
* Add More Debugging info.
* Add Translations.
